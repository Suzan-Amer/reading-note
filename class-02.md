what is Css?
Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. CSS is easy to learn and understood but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.

CSS Associates Style rules with HTML elements
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.


Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.
Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon.

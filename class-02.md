 ##  WHAT IS THE RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES?
* The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
* Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, firstName might be used to store a person's first name, l astNarne for their last name, and age for their age.
* All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.

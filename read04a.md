### How do  Computers Work?
* starting with what makes a cumputer a cumputer and you look  information is represeented inside the computer 
using electrical singals going on and off at maind boggling speeds 

### how computers use circuits 
* the circuits  it is do evrything from simple math to simulating entire virtual worlds
### the 4 parts of a computer
* input , output store all the information

### they are 4 things common to all computers 
* input  
    * They are the tools that we use to enter data, such as the keyboard, mouse, touch and camera that converts the information you take from one and zero
* storage 

 
* processing 
* output
  * Inputs through one and zero are converted to images, sounds, texts, and may be
#### and this make computers a computers

## ones & zero 
### computers work on ones & zero ,ones & zero do play a big role in hoe computers work on the inside 

### and inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer
 
## THE BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM
### in the THE BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM we have digits from zero to nine and thats how we have learned to count in the binarry system , we only have tow digits ; zero & one with these tow digits we can count up to any number what abuot text, images sound all these can also be represented with numbers.
### ***HOW?***

 * text in bainary  
    * Each letter has its number distinguished from  ones & zero for example A (100000) B(010000)
* Images in bainary 
  * Pictures have a lot of pixels, and every pixel has a color and every color has a number ones & zero

  ## Software and hardware 
  ### when you see inside a computing device you see a bunch of circuits , chips , wires , and all sort of other stuff its called hardware 
  ### Software is all the computer programs, or code , running on the machine it is can be anything like games ,maps and apps

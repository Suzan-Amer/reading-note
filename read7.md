## Foreground Color
### There are 3 ways to define colors
* rgb values
  * These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. *** For example: rgb(100,100,90) *** 

* hex codes
  * These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash #sign. *** For example: #ee3e80***

* color names
  * There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. *** For example:DarkCyan***

  ##  Background Color
### CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.
#### You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors:
 * RGB values
* hex codes
*  color names
  
  ## Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

 ## Chapter 8  ***Extra Markup***
 ### Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML. The latest version is html 5

#### In each release there are some improvements and new tags, but not available for everyone, this depends on the type of laptop used and the version installed on the laptop

* DOCTYPEs
   * Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included),the use of a DOCTYPE can also help the browser to render a page correctly. 

* Comment in HTML
     *If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user’s browser, you can add the text between these characters:


* ID Attribute
    *  Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character).It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their idattributes So you can edit it in the css screen

* Class Attribute    
  *  Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page So you can edit it in the css    
* Block Elements
  * Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window.for example <p>
